# CreaturePack Accelerated WebAssembly Module

This folder contains files used for the **CreaturePack Accelerated WebAssembly** playback of Creature exported characters. [**WebAssembly**](http://webassembly.org/) is a web-based technology stack that allows for native code to be compiled and deployed on a web-based platform. This is especially useful for high quality, high performance animation playback.
